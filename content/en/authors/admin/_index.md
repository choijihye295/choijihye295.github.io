I'm Jihye Choi, and I'm majoring in computer engineering at Jeonbuk National University. Recently, I'm interested in fintech, and among them, I participated in 'Korea Fintech Week 2024' to see more about certification and security in non-face-to-face transactions and watched booths and seminars.

This semester, we are working on a capstone project related to smart greenhouses with the Agricultural Science Institute, and we are learning about data preprocessing.
